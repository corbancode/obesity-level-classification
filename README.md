## 1. Obesity Level Estimation Using Machine Learning
This study investigates the effectiveness of various machine learning algorithms for obesity level classification using lifestyle and anthropometric data. The research aims to develop a clinically validated prediction model that can assist healthcare professionals in early obesity risk assessment and intervention planning.


#### OBJECTIVES:
1. Compare performance of Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector 
    Machine, and Logistic Regression for obesity classification
2. Evaluate the impact of proper feature encoding on model performance
3. Identify the most suitable algorithm for obesity level prediction
4. **Clinical Validation:**
   - Assess model interpretability for clinical decision-making
   - Validate prediction accuracy against established clinical obesity classification standards
   - Evaluate model performance across different demographic groups to ensure clinical applicability
   - Analyze feature importance to identify clinically relevant risk factors
   - Test model robustness for real-world healthcare deployment scenarios

#### DATASET: ObesityDataSet_raw_and_data_sinthetic.csv
- Contains 2111 samples with 17 features
- 7 obesity levels: Insufficient_Weight, Normal_Weight, Overweight_Level_I, Overweight_Level_II, Obesity_Type_I, Obesity_Type_II, Obesity_Type_III
- Features include demographic, anthropometric, and lifestyle factors
- **Clinical Relevance:** Features align with standard clinical obesity assessment parameters used in healthcare practice
